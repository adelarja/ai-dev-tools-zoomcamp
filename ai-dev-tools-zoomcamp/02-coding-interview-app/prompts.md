# Question 1

Let's implement a coding interview app using the next requisites:

The app should be able to do the following:

- Create a link and share it with candidates
- Allow everyone who connects to edit code in the code panel
- Show real-time updates to all connected users
- Support syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Execute code safely in the browser

Use fastAPI for the backend and React + Vite for the frontend. In addition, we need postgres for db. Generate the OpenAPI Spect.

Follow the directives in AGENT.md. FYI, I already have the project into a git repo, so you don't need to create a new repo.
